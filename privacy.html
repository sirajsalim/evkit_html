                        <p>At EVKit, your privacy isn't a feature—it's the foundation. We built EVKit from the ground up to keep your data yours, and yours alone.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="privacy-section">
                        <h2>The Short Version</h2>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li><strong>All calculations happen on your device.</strong> We never send your vehicle data, journeys, or charging costs to our servers.</li>
                            <li><strong>Anonymized analytics only.</strong> We collect anonymized app usage patterns to improve EVKit—no personal information, no location data, no identifiable tracking.</li>
                            <li><strong>No account required.</strong> EVKit works entirely offline without any login or registration.</li>
                            <li><strong>iCloud sync is optional and private.</strong> If you enable sync, your data stays in your private iCloud account—we can't access it.</li>
                            <li><strong>We can't see your data. Ever.</strong> Not your vehicles, not your journeys, not your charging rates. Nothing.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="privacy-section">
                        <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
                        <p>EVKit is designed to collect as little information as possible:</p>

                        <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li><strong>Vehicle profiles:</strong> Make, model, efficiency, battery capacity, and custom names you assign (e.g., "My Model Y").</li>
                            <li><strong>Charging rates:</strong> Your home, work, and public charging rates per kWh.</li>
                            <li><strong>Journey calculations:</strong> Distance, charging location, and winter mode preferences.</li>
                            <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Your preferred units (miles/km), currency, region, and display preferences.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Where this data is stored:</strong> Exclusively on your device using SwiftData. This data never leaves your device unless you enable iCloud sync (see below).</p>

                        <h3>Optional iCloud Sync</h3>
                        <p>If you enable iCloud sync in Settings:</p>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li>Your vehicle profiles and settings sync to your private iCloud account via CloudKit.</li>
                            <li>This data is encrypted using your Apple ID credentials.</li>
                            <li>We (EVKit developers) cannot access, read, or decrypt your iCloud data.</li>
                            <li>You can disable iCloud sync at any time in Settings → iCloud.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Information We Don't Collect</h3>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li>❌ No personal information (name, email, phone number, Apple ID)</li>
                            <li>❌ No location data (we don't track where you drive or your GPS coordinates)</li>
                            <li>❌ No identifiable tracking (no device IDs, advertising IDs, or IP addresses)</li>
                            <li>❌ No vehicle or journey data (your EV details, costs, and trips stay on your device)</li>
                            <li>❌ No payment information (handled by Apple via App Store)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="privacy-section">
                        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
                        <p>Since all your data stays on your device, we don't "use" it in the traditional sense. EVKit performs all calculations locally:</p>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li><strong>Journey cost calculations:</strong> Distance ÷ Efficiency × Charging Rate (all math happens on your device).</li>
                            <li><strong>Multi-vehicle comparisons:</strong> Comparing costs across your saved vehicles (locally).</li>
                            <li><strong>Battery degradation predictions:</strong> Projecting future range based on chemistry and age (locally).</li>
                            <li><strong>Widgets and complications:</strong> Displaying your data on your home screen and Apple Watch (locally).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>No server processing. No cloud analysis. No AI training.</strong> Your data powers your calculations, period.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="privacy-section">
                        <h2>Anonymized Analytics</h2>
                        <p>To improve EVKit and understand how features are used, we collect <strong>anonymized, aggregated usage data</strong> using TelemetryDeck, a privacy-focused analytics platform designed for Apple developers.</p>

                        <h3>What We Collect (Anonymously)</h3>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li><strong>Feature usage:</strong> Which screens you visit, which calculators you use, which widgets you add.</li>
                            <li><strong>App interactions:</strong> Button taps, gesture patterns, navigation flows.</li>
                            <li><strong>Technical data:</strong> App version, iOS version, device type (e.g., "iPhone 15 Pro").</li>
                            <li><strong>Performance metrics:</strong> App launch time, screen load times, responsiveness.</li>
                            <li><strong>Crash reports:</strong> Stack traces and error logs to identify and fix bugs.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>What We DON'T Collect</h3>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li>❌ No personal information (name, email, Apple ID)</li>
                            <li>❌ No location data (GPS, region, country)</li>
                            <li>❌ No vehicle data (makes, models, efficiency, battery capacity)</li>
                            <li>❌ No journey data (distances, costs, charging rates)</li>
                            <li>❌ No user-created content (vehicle names, custom rates, notes)</li>
                            <li>❌ No identifiable data (device IDs, advertising IDs, IP addresses)</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>How Anonymization Works</h3>
                        <p>TelemetryDeck uses <strong>salted hashing</strong> to anonymize all data before it leaves your device:</p>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li>Your device generates a random identifier that changes periodically.</li>
                            <li>This identifier is salted and hashed, making it impossible to link back to you.</li>
                            <li>We receive only aggregated, anonymized statistics (e.g., "42% of users use the journey calculator weekly").</li>
                            <li>Even TelemetryDeck cannot identify individual users or link sessions together.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Why We Use Analytics</h3>
                        <p>Anonymized analytics help us:</p>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li><strong>Improve features:</strong> Identify which calculators are most valuable and which need refinement.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fix bugs:</strong> Detect crashes and performance issues affecting users.</li>
                            <li><strong>Prioritize development:</strong> Focus on features that matter most to EV shoppers and owners.</li>
                            <li><strong>Optimize performance:</strong> Identify slow screens and improve responsiveness.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Opt-Out</h3>
                        <p>We're exploring options to let you disable analytics entirely while still using EVKit. Check back for updates in future releases.</p>
                        <p>TelemetryDeck's approach ensures that even if you don't opt out, we cannot identify you or access your personal data.</p>

                        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
                        <p><strong>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal data with anyone.</strong></p>
                        <p>The only data sharing that occurs:</p>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> When you purchase EVKit, Apple processes the transaction. We receive anonymized sales data (e.g., "3 purchases in the UK") but no personal information.</li>
                            <li><strong>CloudKit (optional):</strong> If you enable iCloud sync, your data syncs to your private iCloud account. Apple encrypts this data end-to-end.</li>
                            <li><strong>TelemetryDeck (analytics):</strong> Anonymized, aggregated usage data (screen views, feature usage, crashes) is sent to TelemetryDeck. No personal or identifiable information is included.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>We never share:</strong> Your vehicle profiles, journey data, charging rates, or any information that identifies you. We have no advertising networks or social media trackers.</p>

                            <li><strong>Device encryption:</strong> All local data is encrypted by iOS automatically.</li>
                            <li><strong>iCloud encryption:</strong> If syncing, your data is encrypted in transit and at rest using your Apple ID.</li>
                            <li><strong>No server = no server breaches:</strong> Since we don't store your data on servers, there's no central database to hack.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sandboxed storage:</strong> EVKit's data is isolated from other apps by iOS.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                            <li><strong>Export:</strong> Your data is stored in standard SwiftData format on your device.</li>
                            <li><strong>Disable sync:</strong> Turn off iCloud sync in Settings → iCloud at any time.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Under GDPR and CCPA, you have rights including data portability, deletion, and access. Since we don't collect or store your personal data on servers, most of these rights are inherently satisfied by EVKit's design.</p>
