                    <div class="privacy-intro">
                        <p>At EVKit, your privacy isn't a feature—it's the foundation. We built EVKit from the ground up to keep your data yours, and yours alone.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="privacy-section">
                        <h2>The Short Version</h2>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li><strong>All calculations happen on your device.</strong> We never send your vehicle data, journeys, or charging costs to our servers.</li>
                            <li><strong>No tracking.</strong> We don't use analytics, advertising SDKs, or third-party trackers.</li>
                            <li><strong>No account required.</strong> EVKit works entirely offline without any login or registration.</li>
                            <li><strong>iCloud sync is optional and private.</strong> If you enable sync, your data stays in your private iCloud account—we can't access it.</li>
                            <li><strong>We can't see your data. Ever.</strong> Not your vehicles, not your journeys, not your charging rates. Nothing.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="privacy-section">
                        <h2>What Information We Collect</h2>
                        <p>EVKit is designed to collect as little information as possible:</p>

                        <h3>Information You Provide</h3>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li><strong>Vehicle profiles:</strong> Make, model, efficiency, battery capacity, and custom names you assign (e.g., "My Model Y").</li>
                            <li><strong>Charging rates:</strong> Your home, work, and public charging rates per kWh.</li>
                            <li><strong>Journey calculations:</strong> Distance, charging location, and winter mode preferences.</li>
                            <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Your preferred units (miles/km), currency, region, and display preferences.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>Where this data is stored:</strong> Exclusively on your device using SwiftData. This data never leaves your device unless you enable iCloud sync (see below).</p>

                        <h3>Optional iCloud Sync</h3>
                        <p>If you enable iCloud sync in Settings:</p>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li>Your vehicle profiles and settings sync to your private iCloud account via CloudKit.</li>
                            <li>This data is encrypted using your Apple ID credentials.</li>
                            <li>We (EVKit developers) cannot access, read, or decrypt your iCloud data.</li>
                            <li>You can disable iCloud sync at any time in Settings → iCloud.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Information We Don't Collect</h3>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li>❌ No location data (we don't track where you drive)</li>
                            <li>❌ No analytics or usage tracking</li>
                            <li>❌ No advertising identifiers</li>
                            <li>❌ No personal information (name, email, phone number)</li>
                            <li>❌ No payment information (handled by Apple via App Store)</li>
                            <li>❌ No crash reports unless you explicitly opt in via iOS Settings</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="privacy-section">
                        <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
                        <p>Since all your data stays on your device, we don't "use" it in the traditional sense. EVKit performs all calculations locally:</p>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li><strong>Journey cost calculations:</strong> Distance ÷ Efficiency × Charging Rate (all math happens on your device).</li>
                            <li><strong>Multi-vehicle comparisons:</strong> Comparing costs across your saved vehicles (locally).</li>
                            <li><strong>Battery degradation predictions:</strong> Projecting future range based on chemistry and age (locally).</li>
                            <li><strong>Widgets and complications:</strong> Displaying your data on your home screen and Apple Watch (locally).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><strong>No server processing. No cloud analysis. No AI training.</strong> Your data powers your calculations, period.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="privacy-section">
                        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
                        <p><strong>We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your data with anyone.</strong></p>
                        <p>The only "sharing" that occurs:</p>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> When you purchase EVKit, Apple processes the transaction. We receive anonymized sales data (e.g., "3 purchases in the UK") but no personal information.</li>
                            <li><strong>CloudKit (optional):</strong> If you enable iCloud sync, your data syncs to your private iCloud account. Apple encrypts this data end-to-end.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>We have no third-party SDKs, no analytics platforms, no advertising networks. EVKit is a self-contained app with zero external dependencies.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="privacy-section">
                        <h2>Data Security</h2>
                        <p>Your data is protected through multiple layers:</p>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li><strong>Device encryption:</strong> All local data is encrypted by iOS automatically.</li>
                            <li><strong>iCloud encryption:</strong> If syncing, your data is encrypted in transit and at rest using your Apple ID.</li>
                            <li><strong>No server = no server breaches:</strong> Since we don't store your data on servers, there's no central database to hack.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sandboxed storage:</strong> EVKit's data is isolated from other apps by iOS.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="privacy-section">
                        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
                        <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li><strong>Access:</strong> All your data is visible in the app (vehicles, settings, calculations).</li>
                            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> Delete individual vehicles, clear journey history, or delete the entire app to remove all data.</li>
                            <li><strong>Export:</strong> Your data is stored in standard SwiftData format on your device.</li>
                            <li><strong>Disable sync:</strong> Turn off iCloud sync in Settings → iCloud at any time.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Under GDPR and CCPA, you have rights including data portability, deletion, and access. Since we don't collect or store your personal data on servers, most of these rights are inherently satisfied by EVKit's design.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="privacy-section">
                        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                        <p>EVKit does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app is designed for general audiences and does not require age verification. If you believe a child has used EVKit and shared personal information, please contact us.</p>

                    <div class="privacy-section">
                        <h2>International Users</h2>
                        <p>EVKit is available worldwide and complies with:</p>
                        <ul class="privacy-list">
                            <li><strong>GDPR (EU):</strong> We don't process personal data, so GDPR obligations are minimal.</li>
                            <li><strong>CCPA (California):</strong> We don't sell personal information.</li>
                            <li><strong>UK GDPR:</strong> Same as EU GDPR compliance.</li>

                        </ul>
                        <p>All calculations happen on your device regardless of your location. Regional defaults (charging rates, currencies) are provided for convenience but stored locally.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="privacy-section">
                        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

                        <p>Continued use of EVKit after policy changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="privacy-section">
                        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
